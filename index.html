    <h2>Reducing Diagnostic Errors and Triage Delays</h2>
    <p>
      This educational prototype demonstrates how AI-powered Clinical Decision Support Systems
      can help clinicians triage patients faster, detect red flags, and standardize diagnosis decisions.

    <h2>How Triage & Diagnosis Work</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Triage</h3>
        <p>Initial assessment, vital signs, and red-flag screening to assign a risk level.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Diagnostic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>History, physical examination, and investigations to narrow down likely conditions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>Clinical Decision</h3>
        <p>Prioritizing high-risk patients and selecting an evidence-based management plan.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="note">
      AI-CDSS supports each stage by analysing multiple data points and highlighting patterns, but the final decision always remains with clinicians.
